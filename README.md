A tool for assembling large addins. Given a config file, some island.xml files and a text.xml file, a goomod folder will be created containing most of the mod's assets, notably levels, gooballs and resources. The MapWorldView is also included in the mod. Any files defined in the merge section will need to be done manually. Any custom resources either defined in the resources.xml or ones that override vanilla assets must be manually copied to the goomod. Works with version 1.3. Requires bouncy castle, provider jar can be retrieved from here: https://www.bouncycastle.org/download/bouncy-castle-java/#latest
